# ITBC_project_MilosAntic

This repository contains my final project completed during the IT Bootcamp. The project focuses on website https://demoqa.com/ testing. The main objective was to create a test plan in Excel, automate selected test cases, and create a Postman collection for the https://demoqa.com/swagger/#/ API.

To accomplish this, I created a new Maven/Java project named "ITBC_project_firstname_lastname" and included all the necessary libraries. The project utilizes various testing frameworks and libraries for efficient and reliable automation.

The automated test cases cover critical functionalities of the website, ensuring that it performs as expected. These automated tests provide quick and accurate feedback on the website's functionality, improving the overall quality and reliability of the application.

In addition to test automation, I also created a Postman collection to interact with the API provided by the demoqa.com website. This collection enables seamless testing and integration with the API endpoints, ensuring their proper functioning.

To share my project with others and showcase my skills, I have created a corresponding GitHub repository with the same name as the project. The entire project, including the test plan, automation code, and Postman collection, has been uploaded to this repository.

Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions. I hope this project demonstrates my proficiency in testing, automation, and API testing, showcasing my capabilities as a software tester after completing the IT Bootcamp.

Thank you for your attention
